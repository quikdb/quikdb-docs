Follow these steps to install the QuikDB SDK using your preferred package manager.

Next you may use your preferred package manager as shown below:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="npm" active>

  ```bash
  npm install quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="yarn">

  ```bash
  yarn add quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

> **Note:** Installing globally allows you to access the `quikdb` command from any directory.

---

### Additional Notes

- **Permissions:** If you encounter permission issues while installing globally, you might need to use `sudo` (for Unix-based systems) or run your terminal as an administrator (for Windows). For example:

  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that your system's PATH includes the directory where global `npm` or `yarn` packages are installed. This is typically handled automatically, but if you encounter issues accessing the `quikdb` command, you may need to adjust your PATH manually.

- **Updating the SDK:** To update the QuikDB SDK to the latest version, you can run:

  ```bash
  npm update -g quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn global upgrade quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

### Initialize QuikDB Instance in your code.

With the SDK installed, you can now initialize an instance of QuikDB in your project. This instance will be used to interact with QuikDB canisters.

```typescript
import { QuikDB } from 'quikdb-cli-beta/v1/sdk';

const quikdb = new QuikDB();

(async () => {
  await quikdb.init();
  console.log('QuikDB initialized successfully.');
})();
```

### Step 5: Start Using Canister Methods

You're now ready to perform various operations such as creating schemas, managing records, and querying data. Refer to the [Canister Methods](./canister-methods) section for detailed information on available methods and their usage.
