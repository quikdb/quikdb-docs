###### Quick Start Guide to Begin Using the QuikDB BETA SDK

### Step 1: Configure Your Environment

Before installing the SDK, you need to configure your environment based on how you authenticated with QuikDB. Follow the appropriate command below:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Email & Password Authentication" active>

  ```bash
  quikdb config -u <username> -e <email@example.com>
  ```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="Internet Identity Authentication">

  ```bash
  quikdb config -u <username> -i <identity>
  ```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

> **Note:** The `identity` is automatically generated by the system when you log in using Internet Identity.

**Parameters:**

- `-u, --username <username>`: Your chosen username.
- `-e, --email <email>`: Your email address (for Email & Password authentication).
- `-i, --identity <identity>`: Your Internet Identity identifier (for Internet Identity authentication).

**Example:**

```bash
# Using Email & Password
quikdb config -u johndoe -e johndoe@example.com

# Using Internet Identity
quikdb config -u johndoe -i abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

### Step 2: Install the QuikDB SDK

After configuring your environment, proceed to install the QuikDB SDK. Use your preferred package manager as shown below:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="npm" active>

  ```bash
  npm install -g quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="yarn">

  ```bash
  yarn global add quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

> **Note:** Installing globally allows you to access the `quikdb` command from any directory.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Ensure that the SDK has been installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
quikdb --version
```

**Expected Output:**

```
quikdb-cli-beta version 1.0.0
```

### Step 4: Initialize QuikDB Instance

With the SDK installed, you can now initialize an instance of QuikDB in your project. This instance will be used to interact with QuikDB canisters.

```typescript
import { QuikDB } from 'quikdb-cli-beta/v1/sdk';

const quikdb = new QuikDB();

(async () => {
  await quikdb.init();
  console.log('QuikDB initialized successfully.');
})();
```

### Step 5: Start Using Canister Methods

You're now ready to perform various operations such as creating schemas, managing records, and querying data. Refer to the [Canister Methods](./canister-methods.md) section for detailed information on available methods and their usage.
